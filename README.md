# SnapDecal Project

This is the documentation for the SnapDecal project made by Susanna and Zachary.

##Browser Detection

### Browser Compatibility Check

Our project is to add a feature to Snap which checks which browser the user is running. This 
will ensure the best user experience by making sure that users will are not using incompatible browsers.

If the user is not using *Chrome* or *FireFox*, a warning message will appear adivsing the user to switch
to a compatible browser.

### Browser Usage Statistics

Since we are able to determine which browser every user is using, we will establish a database for keepig track of usage statistics for each browser.
