# SnapDecal Project

This is the documentation for the SnapDecal project made by Susanna and Zachary.

## Checking for outdated Browser
  
  Our goal is to add a feature to Snap which ensures that the user will not be running
  outdated browsers which may lead to compatibility/functionality issues.
  
  Using the **WhichBrowser** API we will determine the version of the users
  browser and compare that with a list of most recent versions for the specific
  browser.
  
  If the users browser version is out of date, we will display a helpful message adivsing the 
  user to update to the latest browser version in order to have the smoothest Snap experience
  possible.
  
### WhichBrowser API
  The **WhichBrowser** [API](https://github.com/WhichBrowser/WhichBrowser) allows us to 
  obtain a JavaScript Object which will allow us to make queries abut the Browser, 
  specifically which *version* of the browser the user is running.
