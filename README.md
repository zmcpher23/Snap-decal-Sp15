# SnapDecal Project

This is the documentation for the SnapDecal project made by Susanna and Zachary.



##Block Modification
Currently, users can duplicate and delete individual blocks as well as duplicate multiple connected blocks if and only if the user right-clicks for the drop-down menu on the topmost block. We would like to give users the ability to right-click any of the other blocks in the connected component as well. We would also like to extend this feature to deleting blocks since users currently cannot delete multiple connected blocks.
